Today our organization’s network services suddenly stopped responding. 
After investigation by the team, they found that the organization experienced 
a DDoS attack caused by a malicious actor that had sent a flood of ICMP pings 
into the company’s network. The incident management team managed to 
restore critical network services after 2 hours by blocking incoming ICMP 
packets and stopping all non-critical network services.
